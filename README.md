# Blood ðŸ©¸ Discord Bot
 
 ## Hello, and welcome to the *unofficial* **Blood On The Clocktower** Discord bot, ***Blood*** ðŸ©¸!
If you're interested in *hosting it yourself*, jump down to the bottom, where technical aspects will be lined out.

If you're interested in *how to use it*, simply continue reading.

## How to Use
### 1: Invite
Use this [link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=804522025946578974&scope=bot&permissions=17034304) to invite Blood ðŸ©¸ to your server!
### 2: Setup your server
Make sure that your storyteller(s) has a role with the word "storyteller" in it, case insensitive. It does not need any permissions, it is just a way to differentiate who can control games and who shouldn't be moved at night/wakeup.

#### Ex: there are 10 people in a server, and two of them have a role named "Storytellers". They will be able to control the flow of the game, but no one else will.

Make sure that you have a Voice Channel category with the word "night" in it, case insensitive. There should also be enough channels in that category for each player.

#### Ex: There are three Voice Channel catagories: "General", "Day", and "Night Rooms". The "Night Rooms" category has 20 voice channels with random names.

Additionally, sure that there is a text channel that only the storytellers can access. This is where they will execute commands and where Blood ðŸ©¸ will respond.

### 3: Start a game
Use the command **~start** to start a game.

Blood ðŸ©¸ will be bound to the channel that **~start** was executed in, so for the duration of the game, you won't need to use the **~** prefix to execute commands.

#### Ex: You, with a "Storytellers" role, send the message "\~start" in a channel that only storytellers can see. Blood will respond with a confirmation, and will now respond to commands in that channel without needing to use the prefix **\~**.

Now you can send the following commands without a prefix in that channel to continue the flow of the game:

Then, use the command **~end** to end the game.
